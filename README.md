# Outlier-detection-and-removal-using-Percentile-
Outliers are the abnormal or different from the rest of the values. This may be due to measurement error, manual error etc. These outliers affect the analysis and produce less accurate values.

Outlier detection and removal and handling missing values are the most important steps in data preprocessing.

Outlier detection and removal using Percentile:

When the data is widely distributed, removing the outliers using Interquartile range will not be efficient. This may end up in deleting essential datas. Percentile is the extension of IQR range where you can set the range according to the data. For example you can custom the range as 0.1 and 99.0.
